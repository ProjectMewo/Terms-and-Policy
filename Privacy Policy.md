# Introduction

Last Updated: 14th of July, 2024

Here at the Organization of the Neko Discord application, one of my main priorities is the Privacy of my user's data. This Privacy Policy document contains the types of information that is collected by me, "Shimeji" Rin (as referred collectively - "I", or "me"), and how I use it to provide service to my users.

For additional questions, do not hesitate to contact me in [the Support Server on Discord](https://discord.gg/bJemK26), my personal Discord account - `shimeji.rin`, or directly through my email address - [sh1m3ji@disroot.org](mailto:sh1m3ji@disroot.org).

## Consent

By using Neko (as referred collectively - "Service"), you consent to this Privacy Policy and agree to its Terms, also present in this Github repository.

## Information I Collect

I do not ask for your personal information, nor any function apparent in my service collect these types of information. Payment information for further functions of the service (if such feature of my service will ever be implemented) will be handled by Discord, Inc., this service does not store your payment information.

Upon any of the execution of any function made available to you of the service, it will collect your Discord User ID. The service also have access to your presence as a Discord Server Member, however it is not intended to store any sensitive Server Member Information in its database, such as your join date (unless you explicitly ask to show this information).

Your messages in any Discord server's channel with the service's presence (this **does not include** interactions) may be collected and processed for checking explicit inputs. I make this information very clear within the service's Source Code, available within this organization:
- I do not store your messages. The service will only check for specific inputs to reply to you.
- I do not manipulate your messages. The service will only use well-known algorithms to check for necessary and specific series of text.
- However, I **do send your message to a third-party** to process the answer for your specific input, **if and only if** you explicitly match the algorithm's limited conditions, made clear by the function's description.
- You can opt-out from having your messages collected and processed by explicitly stating you want to do so. Upon opting-out, (only) your User ID will be stored as a check to ignore your further messages.
