## Terms
By using the "Service", you immediately agree that you accept the Discord Terms of Service, and agree that your account can be suspended from using the "Service" if you violate the Discord Terms of Service in any way.

## Service Guidelines and Restrictions
Our "Service" allows you to post, link, store and otherwise make available certain information, text or material ("Content"). You are responsible for the data you cho(o)se to share on any sort of media form, website, media channel, mobile website or mobile application related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto that has any kind of relation(s) with the "Service", and the developer is not responsible for the information you share. However, actions will be taken if the "Content" violates the Discord Terms of Service, or the "Service"'s Terms of Service in any way.

As mentioned above, the "Service" allows you to make available the "Content". If the content that you cho(o)se to share include(s) any, but not limited to the following, your account will be permanently suspensed from the "Service":
- Content involving harassment;
- NSFW ("Not Safe For Work") content;
- Any sort of discrimination;
- Threats of any kind;

Using any kind of exploits and/or bad behaviors of the "Service" for personal benefits, and/or affecting the "service" stability/performance, is completely prohibited.

## Modifications
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace any of the Term's section and/or portion at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least a 7 days' notice prior to any new Terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.

Your continued use of the "Service" after we announce any modifications to the Terms on this “Service” will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Terms.

This Term of Service is effective as of **August 11th, 2022**, and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being changed on one of the Official Modifications of the “Service”.
